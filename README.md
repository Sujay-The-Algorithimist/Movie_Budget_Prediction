# Movie_Budget_Prediction
A beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses linear regression to predict movie revenue based on production budget.


# 🎬 Movie Budget vs Revenue Prediction

This project is a simple implementation of *Linear Regression* to predict movie revenue based on its production budget.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Manually created spreadsheet
- Columns:
  - Production Budget (in million $)
  - Worldwide Revenue (in million $)
- Format: CSV

## 📈 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (Online)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## 🚀 What I Did
- Imported and cleaned the dataset
- Visualized the data using matplotlib
- Applied *Linear Regression* using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression
- Plotted the regression line (best fit)
- Calculated *R² score (Goodness of Fit)*: 0.55 (or 55%)
- Predicted the revenue of a movie with a *$50 million* production budget

## 📷 Result
> "A higher budget does not always mean higher revenue, but there's a moderate linear correlation."

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Include more features (e.g., genre, cast, marketing cost)
- Try multiple regression or polynomial regression
- Clean outliers for better accuracy
